However, she hasn't yet established a clear strategic pattern. My priority now is to continue developing my central presence while simultaneously obstructing Alice's possible formations. I'll reinforce the diagonal line initiated by my previous move by placing a piece at [6, 6]. This move solidifies my control over the central diagonal, forcing Alice to respond defensively, and it also creates a secondary threat along the horizontal axis, providing me with more options for future development.\n\nMove: [6, 6]"

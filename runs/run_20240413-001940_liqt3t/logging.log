To effectively defend against this and set up my own offensive opportunities, I need to consider potential positions that block the opponent's diagonal progression while creating favorable conditions for my own pieces. I've identified several candidate moves based on these criteria and calculated their respective scores. Among these, placing my piece at [3, .png] appears to be the optimal choice. This move not only disrupts the opponent's diagonal progression but also initiates a potential diagonal line for myself. Additionally, it maintains flexibility for future moves, allowing me to adapt to the opponent's counter-strategy.\",\n    \"move\": [\n        ¾,\n        ¾\n    ]\n}\n```"

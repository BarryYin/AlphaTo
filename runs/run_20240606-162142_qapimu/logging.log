The code also includes helper functions for checking connections and opportunities in different directions.\n\nTo use the code, you can call the `play_gomoku` function with the current board state and the player's turn. The function will return the updated board state after the player has made their move.\n\nNote that the code assumes a 15x15 board and uses the symbols 'x' and 'o' to represent the two players. Feel free to modify the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.\n\nTo run the code, you can use a Python environment and execute the `play_gomoku` function with the appropriate arguments.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the code:\n\n```python\nboard = [['0' for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\nboard = play_gomoku(board, 'x')\n```\n\nThis will create an empty board and make a move for player 'x'. The resulting board state will be returned.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any questions about the code.",

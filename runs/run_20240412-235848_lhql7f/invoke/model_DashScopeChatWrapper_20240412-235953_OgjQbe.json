Moves are made by specifying row and column indexes, with [0, 0] marking the top-left corner and [14, 14] indicating the bottom-right corner.The number must be int for move.\n2. The goal is to be the first player to form an unbroken line of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n3. If the board is completely filled with pieces and no player has formed a row of five, the game is declared a draw.\n\nNote:\n1. Your pieces are represented by 'x', your opponent's by 'o'. 0 represents an empty spot on the board.\n2. You should think carefully about your strategy and moves, considering both your and your opponent's subsequent moves.\n3. Only an unbroken line of five same pieces will win the game. For example, \"xxxoxx\" won't be considered a win.\n4. Note the unbroken line can be formed in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n\n"

If the opponent's pieces do not have three closely aligned pieces, check whether your own pieces have three pieces that are closely aligned. \nstep4.

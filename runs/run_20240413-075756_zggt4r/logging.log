host: 欢迎来到推理汤面游戏！游戏规则如下：

您将选择一种汤底类型，以此作为接下来推理故事的基础设定。可选汤底类型如下：

1. 红汤：指有死亡情节的汤；
2. 清汤：指没有人死亡的汤；
3. 本格：指没有超自然现象的汤；
4. 变格：指包含超自然现象（如灵异、科幻、超能力、妖怪等）的汤。

请您选择一个汤底类型（回复数字即可），然后我将为您提供一个汤面（即简短的案件描述），您将有若干轮提问机会来推理案件详情。在提问过程中，我会回答“是”、“否”或“与此无关”，以确认您的猜测是否符合汤底设定。当您认为已掌握案件全貌时，可以回复“还原事件”，开始详细阐述您的推理结果。我会根据您的回答与实际汤底的一致性以及回答的完整程度进行评分（满分10分）。游戏开始前，请先选择汤底类型。

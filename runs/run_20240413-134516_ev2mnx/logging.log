host: 欢迎来到侦探推理游戏！您将扮演一名侦探，通过提问和逻辑分析，揭示隐藏在案件背后的真相。

**游戏规则**：
1. 您需要先选择汤底类型，即案件的基本设定。可选类型如下：
   - **1-红汤：**指有死亡情节的汤，即案件涉及谋杀或意外死亡。
   - **2-清汤：**指无人死亡的汤，案件可能涉及盗窃、欺诈、失踪等非致命事件。
   - **3-本格：**指案件中不存在超自然现象，完全基于现实逻辑推理。
   - **4-变格：**指案件包含超自然现象，如灵异、科幻、超能力、妖怪等元素。

请您选择一个汤底类型（回复数字即可），我将为您准备对应的案件汤面。

**示例**：回复`1`选择红汤类型

**案件汤面**：
在一座偏僻的别墅内，主人罗伯特先生被发现死于书房，尸体旁边散落着破碎的古董花瓶碎片。书房门窗紧闭，无明显外力破坏痕迹。现场除罗伯特先生外，还有一位访客杰克的指纹与足迹。罗伯特先生生前曾与杰克有过激烈的争执，原因是罗伯特怀疑杰克盗走了他珍藏的一幅名画。然而，那幅名画在案发后并未在别墅内找到。

您有5轮提问机会来揭示案件真相。请提出您的第一个问题，我会根据案件事实回答“是”、“否”或“与此无关”。

**示例**：提问“罗伯特先生是被杰克杀害的吗？”

Moves are made by specifying row and column indexes, with [0, 0] marking the top-left corner and [14, 14] indicating the bottom-right corner.The number must be int for move.\n2. The goal is to be the first player to form an unbroken line of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n3. If the board is completely filled with pieces and no player has formed a row of five, the game is declared a draw.\n\nNote:\n1. Your pieces are represented by 'x', your opponent's by 'o'. 0 represents an empty spot on the board.\n2. You should think carefully about your strategy and moves, considering both your and your opponent's subsequent moves.\n3. Only an unbroken line of five same pieces will win the game. For example, \"xxxoxx\" won't be considered a win.\n4. Note the unbroken line can be formed in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n\nstrategy:\n1. Defense comes first. Determine whether the opponent's previous moves have formed three connected lines, and whether there are three pieces closely attached in the vertical, horizontal, left diagonal, and right diagonal directions on the board, in the form of OOO. If so, place a piece next to the edge of the opponent's piece, such as OOOX.\n2. The highest probability of winning is to find a way to form a situation where three chess pieces are closely packed together vertically, horizontally, left diagonally, and right diagonally on the chessboard, i.e. XXX\n\nworkflow:\nstep1. based on the opponent's pieces, determine whether the opponent has three pieces that are closely aligned, and pick out the location of the piece. \nstep2. Next, place a piece next to the opponent's three pieces that are closely aligned to prevent the opponent's four pieces from forming a line. \nstep3. If the opponent's pieces do not have three closely aligned pieces, check whether your own pieces have three pieces that are closely aligned. \nstep4. If your own pieces do not have three pieces that are closely aligned, find the piece that has been placed next to the next piece to facilitate the formation of a line of your own pieces.\nMake sure you don't place your piece on a spot that has already been occupied by you and your opponent. like spot [5,6] is already occupied, you can't place your piece on it.\n"

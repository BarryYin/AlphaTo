Moves are made by specifying row and column indexes, with [0, 0] marking the top-left corner and [14, 14] indicating the bottom-right corner.\n2. The goal is to be the first player to form an unbroken line of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n3. If the board is completely filled with pieces and no player has formed a row of five, the game is declared a draw.\n\nNote:\n1. Your pieces are represented by 'x', your opponent's by 'o'. 0 represents an empty spot on the board.\n2. You should think carefully about your strategy and moves, considering both your and your opponent's subsequent moves.\n3. Make sure you don't place your piece on a spot that has already been occupied. like spot [5,6] is already occupied, you can't place your piece on it.\n4. Only an unbroken line of five same pieces will win the game. For example, \"xxxoxx\" won't be considered a win.\n5. Note the unbroken line can be formed in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n"

Currently, there is only one 'o' piece placed at [8, 7], so it doesn't pose an immediate threat. However, since my opponent went first, they might have a strategic plan in mind. As a preventive measure and to initiate my offensive strategy, I'll choose to place my piece at [9, 7]. This move not only starts a potential horizontal line but also opens up possibilities for diagonal lines in two directions. It provides flexibility in my future moves and forces the opponent to react to my position.",

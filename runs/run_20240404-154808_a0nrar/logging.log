    "thought": "I observe that the initial board is empty, providing ample opportunity for strategic placement. As the first player, I should focus on laying the groundwork for multiple possible winning configurations while simultaneously hindering my opponent's ability to do the same. A common opening strategy in Gomoku is to play near the center, aiming to control key intersections or creating fork-like structures that force the opponent to react. Therefore, I choose to play at [7, 7], which is close to the central point of the board and allows for maximum flexibility in establishing potential lines both horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.",

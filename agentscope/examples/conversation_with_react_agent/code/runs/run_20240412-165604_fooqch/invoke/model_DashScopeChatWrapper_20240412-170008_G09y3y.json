Fully understand the tool function and its arguments before using it.\n2. Only use the tool function when it's necessary.\n3. Check if the arguments you provided to the tool function is correct in type and value.\n4. You can't take some problems for granted. For example, where you are, what's the time now, etc. But you can try to use the tool function to solve the problem.\n5. If the function execution fails, you should analyze the error and try to solve it.\n\n"
